    ### Grants Council


    The Grants Council, elected by the Token House community, plays a crucial
    role in providing small to medium-sized grants to support various
    initiatives. These grants are divided into three categories: Builders,
    Experiments, and Requests for Grants (RFGs):

    </div>


    **Builders grants** aim to maximize the number of builders, including
    developers and visionaries, who are building innovative applications on
    Optimism. The Council is particularly interested in projects that align with
    their mission of advancing the Builders community. When reviewing proposals,
    the Council looks for information that demonstrates how the project
    contributes to this mission.


    **Experiments grants** are designed to promote the adoption of novel
    applications and tangible use cases on Optimism. Unlike Builders grants,
    these grants are intended to reach end users and are not for the use of the
    proposer. The proposal forms for Experiments grants are specifically
    designed to gather information on how the project will expand the reach of
    the Optimism ecosystem and enhance the adoption of useful applications.


    **Requests for Grants (RFGs)** represent a transitional moment in the grant
    process. These grants are based on the needs of the Optimism ecosystem and
    are issued as requests for teams to submit proposals that address the most
    pressing problems. The Council specifies the requirements for each request,
    including how to submit a proposal and how the proposals will be assessed.
    The RFG process is dynamic and may be updated periodically.


    The Grants Council follows a five-week cycle during regular Voting Cycles to
    process applications. It is important to refer to the [governance
    calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y19mbm10Z3VoNm5vbzZxZ2JuaTJncGVyaWQ0a0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t)
    for the schedule and deadlines. 



    The following diagram showcases the procedure to submit a proposal:

    ### Token House Missions


    The Token House plays a crucial role in the Optimism Collective by voting on
    approving Missions. These Missions are specific initiatives that align with
    the Collective Intents and can receive grants. You can propose a Mission
    under Intent #1, Intent #3, or Intent #4. All proposals under Intent #2
    should be grant applications that will be processed by the Grants Council.
    The Token House votes on these Missions once per Season, which is roughly
    every four to six months. In Season 4, the Foundation has suggested Intent
    Budgets to align the community around Collective Intents. Let's explore the
    different Intents and their proposed budgets:

    </div>



    One can apply by submitting a [Mission
    proposal](https://gov.optimism.io/t/proposed-mission-template/5882) on the
    forum requesting the grant amount that corresponds to their Trust Tier.
    Mission Proposals will be approval ranked by the Token House every six
    months.
